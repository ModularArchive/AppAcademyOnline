First Program
Write your first program! Using puts, print out a message. Make sure that your message is wrapped up in quotation marks.
Run the code to see the output. Note: You'll notice that one of the lines in the code begins with a #. Adding # to the front 
of a line will create a comment. This line will not be executed as code, so they are useful to write notes to ourselves!
